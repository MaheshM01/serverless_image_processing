# Serverless Image Processing Using AWS

There are only a few steps to follow:

1. Creating an account in AWS.
2. Creating a Source bucket and Destination Bucket.
3. Create an IAM Policy and Role.
4. Create a Lambda Function.

After completing all the above-mentioned steps, the next process is to download the GitHub repository of MaheshM01/serverless_image_processing. There will be a `.zip` file named `sample.zip`. Download the GitHub Repository. After that, upload the `.zip` file in the code source option. Finally, add a Trigger option.

Now the project is ready to use. If we upload an image in the Source file, the output of the image will be displayed in the Destination Bucket in the format of Thumbnail image, Cover image, and passport image in separate folders.
